ðŸ“Œ**Introduction to Wireframing**

Wireframing is a visual guide that represents the skeletal framework of a digital product. It plays a vital role in the design process by helping teams define the layout, structure, and functionality before development begins. This stage allows for early feedback and reduces costly changes later in the project.
